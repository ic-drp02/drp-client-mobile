# NHS Guidelines App - Mobile Client

## Local development

To build the app you will need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once that's installed, run the following:

```
> npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then in the project root you need to run:

```
> npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.

Finally, you can run:

```
> npm start
```

to build and run the app. This will display a QR code in the terminal that you can scan from the Expo client app on your phone to actually run the app on your device.
